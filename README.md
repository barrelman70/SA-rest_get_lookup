I am not repsonsible for any damages or lost data caused to target systems due to abuse or misunderstanding. The software is provided as-is and I take no responsbility for what you (the user) do with it. Use carefully and wisely. The app is designed to be deployed only once and then removed. Using it without careful planning will likely result in tears. :'(
